# Get started

> [!TIP]
> What is the **Azure AI Toolkit(AITK)**? [The AI Toolkit (AITK)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/intelligentapps/overview) is an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides a unified interface to access and interact with various AI models and services. It allows users to easily explore, compare, and utilize different AI models from multiple providers, both proprietary and open source, hosted on several platforms, such as Github, Azure AI Foundry or even locally. With AITK, developers can streamline their Generative AI development workflow by integrating model selection, prompt engineering, and agent prototyping and testing directly within their code editor.

## Sign in to Windows
As a first step, login into the lab Virtual Machine using the following credentials:
- Username: already set to Admin.
- Password: enter +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Win11Base23B-W11-22H2).Password+++ and click.

> [!TIP]
>  First time using **Skillable?** The green "T" (e.g., +++Admin+++) indicates values that are automatically input for you at the current cursor location in VM, with one click. This reduces your effort and minimizes input errors.
> Also, you can always click on the images to enlarge them, if needed.
