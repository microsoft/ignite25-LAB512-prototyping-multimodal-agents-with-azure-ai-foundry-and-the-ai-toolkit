# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a **75-minute** workshop that will give you hand-on experience with the AI Toolkit (AITK) and Azure AI Foundry in Visual Studio Code to prototype multimodal agents for your business scenario.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Explore and compare models in the AITK Model catalog, to select the best fit for your use-case.
- Augment models with prompts and data to get more accurate and grounded responses in the AITK Playground.
- Prototype an agent by combining models and instructions with tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol) using the AITK Agent Builder.

## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into 4 sections, taking you through the process of prototyping a multimodal agent with Azure AI Foundry and the AI Toolkit.

1. **Part 1 - Model Selection** Model selection is an essential step in building AI solutions. In this section, you will explore the AI Toolkit Model Catalog to compare and select models that best fit your business scenario.
2. **Part 2 - Model Augmentation** Once you have selected a model, you will learn how to augment it using prompt engineering and context data to improve its performance and relevance to your specific use case.
3. **Part 3 - Agent Prototyping** In this section, you will use the AITK Agent Builder to prototype an agent. You will combine your selected and augmented models with instructions and tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol).
4. **Part 4 - From Prototype to Code** Finally, you will learn how to export your agent prototype into code that can be integrated into your applications.
