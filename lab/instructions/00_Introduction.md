# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a **75-minute** workshop that will give you hand-on experience with the AI Toolkit (AITK) and Azure AI Foundry in Visual Studio Code to prototype multimodal agents for your business scenario.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:
- Explore and compare models in the AITK Model catalog, to select the best fit for your use-case.
- Augment models with prompts and data to get more accurate and grounded responses in the AITK Playground.
- Prototype an agent by combining models and instructions with tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol) using the AITK Agent Builder.

## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into 4 sections, taking you through the process of prototyping a multimodal agent with Azure AI Foundry and the AI Toolkit.

1. **Part 1 - Model Selection** Model selection is an essential step in building AI solutions. In this section, you will explore the AI Toolkit Model Catalog to compare and select models that best fit your business scenario.
2. **Part 2 - Model Augmentation** Once you have selected a model, you will learn how to augment it using prompt engineering and context data to improve its performance and relevance to your specific use case.
3. **Part 3 - Agent Prototyping** In this section, you will use the AITK Agent Builder to prototype an agent. You will combine your selected and augmented models with instructions and tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol).
4. **Part 4 - From Prototype to Code** Finally, you will learn how to export your agent prototype into code that can be integrated into your applications.

## Business Scenario

In this workshop, you'll be building an AI agent for **Zava**, a leading DIY (Do-It-Yourself) retail company that operates both online e-commerce and multiple physical stores across the United States. Zava specializes in home improvement, hardware, tools, and DIY project supplies, serving customers who range from weekend hobbyists to professional contractors.

### The Challenge

Zava's customers often struggle to find the right products for their DIY projects from the company's extensive catalog of thousands of items. Customers frequently have questions like:
- "What materials do I need for building X?"
- "What's the difference between these two similar tools?"

Additionally, customers want to know:
- **Product availability** in their local stores
- **Online inventory status** for delivery options
- **Detailed product specifications** and compatibility
- **Alternative products** when their first choice isn't available

### The Solution: Cora, Zava's AI Agent

You'll be developing **Cora**, an intelligent customer service agent that can:

1. **Understand multimodal inputs**: Process both text descriptions and images from customers (e.g., photos of their project space or damaged items they need to replace)

2. **Search the product catalog**: Find relevant products from Zava's extensive inventory based on natural language queries and visual inputs

3. **Provide detailed product information**: Share specifications, usage recommendations, and compatibility details

4. **Check availability**: Access real-time inventory data to inform customers about product availability both online and in physical store locations

5. **Offer intelligent recommendations**: Suggest complementary products, alternatives, and complete project solutions

### Why This Matters

This agent will help Zava:
- **Improve customer experience** by providing instant, accurate product assistance
- **Increase sales** through better product discovery and recommendations
- **Reduce support costs** by automating common customer inquiries
- **Support omnichannel strategy** by seamlessly connecting online and in-store experiences

Throughout this workshop, you'll use the AI Toolkit and Azure AI Foundry to build, test, and refine Cora's capabilities, learning how to create AI agents for real business scenarios.
